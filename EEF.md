## Description of the organization affiliated
### IEEE uOttawa
A non-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest professional association for the advancement of technology.

A student branch of the IEEE, the IEEE uOttawa Student Branch is a student association that organizes events and provides services to uOttawa students to enhance their student experience
### CUSEC
The Canadian University Software Engineering Conference is a three-day event that brings together undergraduate and post-graduate students for learning, networking, and sharing their passion for software. CUSEC 2013 will happen from January 17-19, 2013 in Montreal, Quebec.

## Detailed description
### What it is?
This project aims to bring as much students as possible to the 2013 iteration of CUSEC.

My goal is to bring so many uOttawa students to CUSEC that all the other delegations 
 will be dwarfed in comparison.

### What will be done?
* __Seek official support from the Faculty to encourage student's participation.__ We will present a motion to the Faculty Council, requesting professor's collaboration in enabling student's attendance to the conference.  The corpus of this motion can be found [here][1].  

> Many professors already manifested their support, including Marcel Turcotte, Timothy Lethbridge, Daniel Amyot, Herna L. Viktor and Liam Peyton.

* __Promote the event.__ We will go present and sell the project to students in their classes this Fall.  We are also actively promoting the event on Facebook.  We also intend on producing posters to placard the walls of the Faculty's building.
* __Take registration.__ We will manage the purchase of tickets and the booking of hotel rooms on behalf of the delegates.
* __Transport the delegation.__ In collaboration with the Carleton IEEE student branch, we will transport the delegation back and forth to the conference's location.

### Timeline
* __Oct 1, 2012.__ Application for EEF.
* __Oct 16, 2012.__ Presentation of Motion to the Faculty Council.
* __Oct 2012 to early Jan 2013.__ Registration of delegates.
* __Nov 2012 to Jan 2013.__  Promotion of the conference in coordination with uOttawa IEEE and the Vice-Dean of Undergrads - and the Faculty, conditional to the acceptance of the Motion.
* __1900h, Jan 16 2013.__ Departure from uOttawa.
* __Jan 19 2013.__ Return to uOttawa.

### Why we meet the requirements.
* __Request must benefit Engineering students at the University of Ottawa.__ The conference is specifically targetted at Engineering students.  It is a great occasion for them to learn, network and get jobs/internships with top tech companies.
* __The exact nature of this benefit has not been predefined.__ Yes.  (What is the meaning of this sentence anyway?)
* __The allocation committee welcomes novel and innovative project ideas.__ uOttawa has never dwarfed other delegations to CUSEC.  We hope to flood CUSEC's floor with uOttawa delegates.
* __Ideas must fit within University policy.__ The University has been supportive of this conference in the past, and this year again.  The University also provided speakers to the conference in previous years (Timothy Lethbridge, 2002).
* __The maximum amount that can be requested is $9 000.00.__ We request $8 782.00.
* __The EEF cannot pay for food or drink.__ The cost estimate doesn't include food or drink, and the fund received will not be used for such expenses.

## Ptomotion/Marketing
* The conference is actively promoted on Facebook, where 22 students already demonstrated their intention to attend.
* As more speakers and sponsors are confirmed for the conference, we will start to give short presentation about CUSEC to students at the beginning of their classes.
* We expect active support from the professors, asking for their help by accommodating delegates and by recommending the conference to their students.
