#Preamble:

Many undergraduate students are involved in extracurricular activities relevant to their engineering or computer science education, such as attending conferences and participating in competitions. They would like support of the Faculty when approaching professors seeking accommodation for absences. There is concern that some faculty members may not be aware that such activites are encouraged.

#Motion:

Resolved that Faculty Council encourages the involvement of students in extracurricular activities relevant to their education and professional development. Faculty Council therefore encourages faculty members to accommodate students who request the following in order to attend such activities:

* Absences from class.

* Absences from labs (it being understood that makeup work may be required).

* Absences from midterms or quizzes (with the understanding that professors cannot be expected to create special makeup tests, hence accommodation would normally consist of adding additional weight to the exam or to other course components).

* Delays in assignment deadlines (with the understanding that in the case of assignments where requirements are published several weeks in advance, students may instead be required to hand in work before they leave).

# It is also understood that:

* Students are required to request accommodation as far in advance as possible, and in no case is a professor obliged to consider an accommodation request 'after the fact'.

* Faculty members would not be expected to provide more than two days of accommodation in any given course.

* Accomodation must be for educational or professional development activities directly relevant to the student's program such as conferences and competitions, or for Faculty activities such as attending Faculty Council or departmental meetings.

* Faculty members may require evidence of participation, or the legitimacy of the activity, such as a letter from another professor.

* Accommodation cannot be granted for missed final exams.

* The above accommodations are distinct from, and should be considered additional to, those requested by the co-op office for co-op interviews.

* When a large group of students expect to attend the same extra-curricular event together, they are requested to inform the department/school chair/director who can then assist them by informing all faculty members of the need for accommodation.
