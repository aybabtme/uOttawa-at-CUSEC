# uOttawa at CUSEC ! ! !

## UPDATES

Buy your tickets before December 10 (2012) to get up to 100%* refund.

### How to?
During the exam period, the STE4026 is often closed. 

You still want your spot at CUSEC reserved? Easy.

1. Print this form:

2. Fill it.
3. Fill a CHEQUE of 180$ at the name of "IEEE uOttawa Student Branch". Stick it to the form (with tape please).
4. Drop it under the door of STE4026.
5. Win! You're registered. I'll send you an email to confirm I got your registration.

\* Percentage varies depending on quantity of students buying tickets.  For a table of expected refunds, [click here][1].
