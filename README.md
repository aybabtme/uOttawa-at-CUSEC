## How to Prepare for the Career Fair

### Preparing your resume
One thing you __should__ do is register for the _Resume Roast_ thingy, [here][10].  Why is that?  What is that?

#### What ?
You submit your resume ahead of time (like ASAP, your resume should be ready by now anyway).  Then at CUSEC, there will be this _Resume Roast_ thingy where recruiters will destroy your resume in front of an audience.  Now you're like "I don't want to be humiliated in front of everybody" and I'll say _you won't_.  It's a game, but you're the winner in this. Why?

#### Why ?

1. First, those recruiters will ask you questions when they'll analyze your resume, so they'll incidently get to know you more than they would get to know random people showing up at their booth.
2. Second, _they will fix your resume for you_, so that all you need to do after that is to take that fixed resume, and use it!  And win!
3. Finally, participating in this kind of stuff shows that you _care_, and recruiters want people who care.

### Knowing the basics

The sponsors are all listed [here][11].  Their logos, when you click on them, point on their _jobs_ page.  So just browse those page and look for the kind of job you want (full-time/internships).

Once you've identified the jobs they offer, you might be like "Operations, what's that?? _<insert title>_, what's that??".  Google is your friend!  Do the search, because when you'll go to their booth and give them your résumé, they'll ask you for which position you're interested.  If you have no clue about what _<insert title>_ means, you'll look like a moron.

Also, do search what the sponsors are all about.  For instance, _Shopify_ are an e-commerce platform and they look for Rails developer, mostly.  You should know that before you go to their booth.

### Preparing for interviews

An [excellent book][13] you should own so that you pwn technical interviews. Or [this website][12] (related to the book).


### Specific tips

* __Shopify__ are looking for people with experience in web development and _Ruby, Rails_ and Javascript/Coffeescript and other things around this planet.  _Doug Tezner_, their Head of Aquisition, will be there and he said:

> I will actually be doing a talk on this very subject (the hiring process, do's and don'ts etc).
>
> We are really big on personal coding projects and not that big on CV's.  I always like when students can talk/show an app they have built themselves, outside of school or work…

* __Google__ sent us all a beautiful email about how to apply for their stuff.  Do it, and send an email to _Amy Yeung_ (`her_name_without_spaces@google.com`).
