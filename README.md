# uOttawa at CUSEC ! ! !

## UPDATES

<del>Buy your tickets before December 10 (2012) to get up to 100%* refund.</del>
We've used all of our funds in our pre-December 10 sales!  I'll try to get more, 
but if you buy your ticket in the mean time, assume that there will be no reimbursement!

If you bought your ticket on or before December 10, you will get a reimbursement.  The amount
of said reimbursement has yet to be computer, and will be redistributed after the conference.

### How to?
During the off-class period, the IEEE office at STE4026 is more often than not closed. 

You still want your spot at CUSEC reserved? Easy.

* Print this form:
http://tinyurl.com/bbvel23
* Fill it.
* Fill a CHEQUE of __198$__ at the name of "IEEE uOttawa Student Branch". Stick it to the form (with tape please).
* Drop it under the door of STE4026.
* Win! You're registered. I'll send you an email to confirm I got your registration, whenever I come by the
office and grab it!

> _"Wooo, I thought it was 180$ !!"_ 

That was before Dec 10, sorry.  The price is 60$ for the ticket and 120$ + tax for the hotel!
